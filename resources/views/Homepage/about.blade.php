                    Introduction: Every patient has the fundamental right to receive a good quality of care at the place where he/she lives. A home is a place of memories, familiarity and safety, a place where we remain comfortable, relaxed and confident and the best place for freedom of choice and autonomy. It is possible to manage patients with advanced diseases at home.

                    Establishment of affordable, accessible and quality Care facilities in the community will reduce the hospitalization of patients with incurable illnesses. This will be a welcome step as people will be at home during the end-stage of their lives. Establishment of quality community-based health-care services at a home level will provide emotional and spiritual support and helps in preventing and minimising complications in bed-ridden patients. This can be done in partnership with the family/ neighbourhood/ local community as they have a keen interest in the wellbeing of the patient.

                    End of life Care patients are mostly bedridden and cannot come to an OPD of a hospital. Such patients will need to be cared for at a hospice or their homes. Since most of our patients prefer to be cared at homes, home care services should be provided. Home based Care has several additional advantages for the patient and family such as comfort, privacy, familiarity with surroundings, security, autonomy and a greater degree of independence. It is also cost effective and as it does not entail travelling to the hospital repeatedly for follow up visits and unnecessary investigations and treatments.
